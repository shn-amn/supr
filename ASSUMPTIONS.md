# Assumptions

* All weights/values of nodes are integers.
* If the user types an illegal row in the console, like `3 eight 5`, 
  they would like to have a second chance to enter the row. 
  In my implementation, the programme prompts the user until a correct line is submitted,
  or an empty line is entered. 
  In the latter case, the programme considers the triangle finished.
